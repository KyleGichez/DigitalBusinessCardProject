## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I have learned how to build a digital business card using display flex to align the two cards next to each other.

```css
.main--app {
  display: flex;
  width: 1500px;
  height: 1200px;
}
```

### Continued development

I am still learning how to use the margins and padding to align the cards in one webpage that is not scrollable.
